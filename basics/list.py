# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
footballers = ["messi","mbappe","neymar"]
print(footballers)

# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
print(footballers[0]) # This will print the first item on the list , which is messi

# The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
# Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value
